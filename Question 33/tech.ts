//Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. 
//Store these pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
//• Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza 
//instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should
// have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.

//• Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop,
// that states how much you like pizza.
// The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza
// you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!

const favoritePizzas: string[] = ["fjita", "pepperoni ", "BBQ Chicken"];

// Printing the name of each pizza
console.log("My favorite pizzas:");
for (const pizza of favoritePizzas) {
    console.log(pizza)
};

// Printing a sentence using the name of each pizza
console.log("\nMore about my favorite pizzas:");
for (const pizza of favoritePizzas) {
    console.log(`I like ${pizza}  pizza.`)
};

// Additional sentence about loving pizza
console.log("\n I really love pizza! \n");

console.log('THE END');
