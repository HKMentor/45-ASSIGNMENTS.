//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a
// common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list,
// and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.
// • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, 
//such as A dog would make a great pet.
// • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common.\
// You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
var animals = ["Dog", "Cat", "Rabbit"];
// Printing the name of each animal
console.log("Animals:");
for (var _i = 0, animals_1 = animals; _i < animals_1.length; _i++) {

    console.log(animal);
}
// Printing a statement about each animal
console.log("\nMore about these animals:");
